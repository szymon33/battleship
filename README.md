The Battleship is an application which implements [Battleship (game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) in Ruby language. This document contains implementation notes and gotcha's.

## Usage notes

* You can use the game like in the following file: [console.rb](lib/console.rb)

* You could test/play by yourself in interactive mode/console by typing

   ```ruby
   ruby lib/console.rb
   ```

* The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). This is game variant when ships can tauch only diagonal.
